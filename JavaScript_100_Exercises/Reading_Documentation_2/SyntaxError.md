Running this code raises the following error message

SyntaxError: Unexpected token &&

Fix the code.

let speedLimit = 60;
let currentSpeed = 80;

if ((currentSpeed > speedLimit) && ((currentSpeed - speedLimit) > 5)) {
  console.log('"People are so bad at driving cars ' +
    'that computers don\'t have to be that good to be much better." ' +
    '-- Marc Andreessen');
}

The code was fixed by adding additional parentheses around the expression in the if statement
